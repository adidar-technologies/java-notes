What is Java:   
   Java is Object Oriented Programming Language.
   Java released in year 1995(James Gosling)
   Write Once, Run anywhere. 

   Java is a High level Language.
      - It abstracts the hardware details  
      - Easy to understand
      - Easy to write
      - Human Understandable. 
      - It requires Compiler to convert code into Machine code. 

  Low Level Language:
     - Machine level Language
  Advantage - It is faster compared to HLL.
     - More Efficient    
   Disdavntages-
       Difficult to read the Code
       More Understanding about the Hardware.

Features Of Java-
  Platform independent - Write Once, Run anywhere.
     Once you compile the java program, you will get a .class file. You take this .class file to any of the operating systems 
that has JDK installed, then if we give the .class file to it, it executes the code.
  Object oriented - Everything in java is treated as object oriented.
  Secure - Dont have direct memory access.
  xyz - 12
  x1yxz - 14
  x2yxz - 20

  add result = xyz + x1yxz

  
  x2yxz = 20
